# Corpus-Q-A-tool

I worked on a project involving two distinct corpuses: The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi and books by Mahrishi Ramana. In the first part, I developed an algorithm to identify top-k paragraphs for a given query by scoring words and paragraphs based on their relevance and frequency in the corpus. This algorithm was evaluated for correctness and efficiency.

The second part focused on querying Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to obtain relevant information based on refined prompts. I explored questions such as the optimal value of k, prompt engineering for better responses, and the possibility of using multiple LLMs. I implemented a class, QNA_tool, to facilitate querying LLMs and handling API calls.

Throughout the project, I utilized data structures like dictionaries, search mechanisms, and scoring algorithms to enhance search efficiency and relevance. The code was implemented in C++ and Python, showcasing proficiency in both languages and API integration skills.
